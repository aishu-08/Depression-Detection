# Depression Detection
## Prediction using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Model
### Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living.

### This detection aids in the assessment of your or a friend's mental health. In this project, I propose a novel approach to detecting depression using text data.
